# Survey App

This is a Django app that makes surveys. With it, users can create their own surveys and answer them. Choices are saved so that people can see how many votes each choice has.

## Getting Started

This app was written with Django 3.1.2. It's recommended to use python's **virtualenv** tool if building locally:

> $ mkvirtualenv *django_env*
> $ python manage.py runserver

Then visit http://localhost:8000 in your web browser to view the app.
